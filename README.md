# webinar-analytics-prediction
This project involves taking input in the form of audio recordings, converting the recordings into text and then using the text as an input to predict a paragraph (using LSTMs) from which we get the topic word (using LDA). The visualisation for the predicted topic words can be best seen in the Colab link as github view doesn't allow pyLDAvis to visualise the data.
